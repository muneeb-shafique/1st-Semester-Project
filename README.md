# 1st Semester Project
This is a Student Grade Management System project developed for the first semester of my Data Science Program at University of Engineering &amp; Technology(UET), Lahore. The system is built using Python and aims to manage and organize student data, including their grades, efficiently.

#Features
<ol>
<li><h3>User Input</h3></li>
The user (teacher/admin) will input the following details for each student:
<ul>
<li>Student Name</li>
<li>Roll Number</li>
<li>Marks for each subject (e.g., AICT, PF, Calculus, etc.)</li>
<li>Other necessary details (optional, like class, section, etc.)</li>
</ul>

<li> Calculations </li>
<ul>

<li>Grades: Calculates grades for each subject and the overall grade.</li>
<li>Percentage: Calculates the percentage based on total marks and maximum possible marks.</li>
<li>Marks: Calculates individual subject marks and total marks.</li>
<li>Position: Ranks students based on their total marks (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<li><h3>Report Generation</h3></li>
Generates a Report Card for each student in the form of an HTML file. The report card includes:
<ul>
<li>Student’s name, roll number, and marks for each subject.</li>
<li>Obtained marks, total marks, percentage, grade, and position.</li>
<li>The report is styled with HTML for better presentation.</li>
</ul>

<li><h3> Additional Features</h3></li>
<ul>
<li>Data Validation: Ensures entered marks are numeric and within valid range.</li>
<li>Report Accessibility: The generated report card is easily shareable and printable.</li>
</ul>
</ol>

# Flow of the System
<ul>
<li>User Input: Teacher/admin enters student data via a user interface.</li>
<li>Processing: The system calculates marks, percentage, grades, and ranks.</li>
<li>Report Generation: After processing, the system generates the student’s report card in HTML format.</li>
<li>Output: The generated report card can be viewed, edited, or printed by the user.</li>
</ul>
